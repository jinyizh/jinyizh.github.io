## More About Me

I am a current student of the Master of Software Development program at the University of Utah. I am passionate about coding and software engineering in general, and I am interested in developing with Ruby on Rails. I am also curious about functional programming, and I am learning to code in Elixir.

Besides these, I also like to learn about computer networking and cloud computing.

I will graduate in December 2023. I am actively looking for SDE job opportunities starting 2024 in the US.

I am totally hooked on music! As a guitar player, music is my jam and my vibe. [Hit me up on Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/jinyizh) if you are a fan too!
